<h1>About</h1>
<p>My name is Alex Sanchez. Film Advisor is a pet project of mine to get myself acquainted with web development using Python and asyncio/aiohttp. You can check the code for this project and some other stuff I'm working on on my <a href="https://github.com/yonjuuni" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a>. Cheers!</p>
